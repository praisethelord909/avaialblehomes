<h2>New Homes in the Country</h2>
<h3>Ault, Briggsdale, Byers, Carr, Deer Trail, Eckley, Frederick, Gill, Keenesburg, Log Lane Village, Roggen, Weldona.
<h3>3/16/2023</h3>
<p>Have you ever dreamed of owning a home on land? We build manufactured homes on land in northern Colorado. We have done all the hard work. We have installed the home on a permanent foundation, added utilities like electric, water, sewer, and gas, and gone through the process of building permits and inspections. There is a lot more time and detail involved, but bottom line, these homes are now complete and waiting for an owner like you! The homes are brand new and come with a builder's warranty. These homes are built with quality and value in mind, so they don't last long. We even have lenders that can help get the ball rolling. My name is Bill, and I created this website to get the word out about these homes. Please call me at 303-931-7411 and I can get you more details. Pricing, terms, and availability are subject to change without notice.  Realtor commission may or may not be included and may or may not be negotiable.</p>

<h3>Call or text Bill at: 303-931-7411 to learn more about these homes and any incentives.</h3>
